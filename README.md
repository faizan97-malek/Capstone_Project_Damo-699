# Capstone_Project_Damo-699
Predictive maintenance using AI4I 2020 sensor data with logistic regression and tree-based models

##  Project Overview
This capstone project explores predictive maintenance using operational and sensor-based data from the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance dataset. The objective of the project is to analyze machine failure patterns and establish a foundation for developing predictive models that support proactive maintenance decision-making.

At this stage, the project is in its initial setup and data preparation phase. The focus is on organizing the repository structure, loading the dataset, and preparing the environment for exploratory data analysis and modeling.
